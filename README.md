# Brainfuck Interpreter
## Goto Challenge:

### Rules:
- No `if, else, while, until, break, return, for, function, repeat, do`, statements
- An exception is allowed for `if` statements if only to strictly nest a goto inside of it to simulate `goto if` statements
- The program must perform it's task successfully
- No external library (calling functions from the standard library is allowed)

This was a self-imposed challenge of trying to program a Brainfuck interpreter using only goto statements for flow control, which took about 1 hour and 20 minutes to program
